ClassCrawler is a command-line tool which generates a GraphViz dot file
representing all or part of the Objective-C class hierarchy.

There are no parameters; the target is hard-coded in the main() function.
To graph more frameworks, just add them to the target and rebuild.

To view, use GraphViz: http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/
